## Home Maintenance Hub Project


**Discription:**

In this project, we develop a website for connecting both _Users_ (i.e., users seeking some sort of home maintenance services) and _Service Providers_ (e.g., Electricians, Plumbers, Carpenters, etc.). Users can post their requests, providing a discription of the problem they have, the category of service they are seeking, emergancy level of the problem, price range, location, contact, etc. Maenwhile, service providers can navigate and review users requests, then offer their services upon acceptance and availabelity, or can reply to users requests a suggestion on how to fix the problem if the emergancy level is not high.

The website will be developed using _HTML_, _Javascrip_t and _CSS_. This project is going to be developed by the following members using _GitHub_ for deployment and for version control using _Git_.
